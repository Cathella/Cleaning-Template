            Dust inevitably settles in airducts over time.
            When your system powers up, dust spreads throughout your home, causing allergies and dirtiness.
            Contaminants, microorganisms, pet dander, mildew and other pollutants also collect in your airducts.
            By periodically getting your airducts cleaned, you’re looking out for your family’s health.
            When ductwork and registers build-up dust and grime, they do not operate as efficiently.
            Anytime air supply is even partially blocked, your system has to work harder to accomplish the same outcome.
            Cleaner systems operate more efficiently.
