        THE CLEAN AIR DUCT DIFFERENCE:

        A cleaner home Better air quality Lower electricity bill
        Dust inevitably settles in
        airducts over time. When
        your system powers up, dust
        spreads throughout your
        home, causing allergies and
        dirtiness. Contaminants,
        microorganisms, pet dander,
        mildew and other pollutants
        also collect in your airducts.
        By periodically getting your
        airducts cleaned, you’re
        looking out for your family’s
        health. When ductwork and registers
        build-up dust and grime, they
        do not operate as efficiently.
        Anytime air supply is even
        partially blocked, your system
        has to work harder to
        accomplish the same
        outcome. Cleaner systems
        operate more efficiently.
